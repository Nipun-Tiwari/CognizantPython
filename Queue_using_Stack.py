# üîç Explanation of Key Parts:
# Two stacks:

# stack_in is for enqueue operations (push new elements).

# stack_out is for dequeue operations (pop front elements).

# When dequeue is called and stack_out is empty, all elements from stack_in are moved to stack_out, reversing their order to simulate queue behavior.

# display() shows current queue order combining both stacks.
