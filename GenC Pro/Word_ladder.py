# üîç Explanation of Key Parts:
# Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in the implicit graph where nodes are words and edges exist if words differ by one letter.

# The helper function is_one_letter_diff checks if two words differ by exactly one character.

# Keeps track of visited words to avoid cycles.

# Converts the word list into a set for efficient membership checking and removal.

# ‚úÖ Data Structure Used:
# Set: For O(1) lookups and removals of words in the dictionary.

# Deque (from collections): To implement BFS queue efficiently.

# Queue: For BFS traversal of possible transformations.

# Let me know if you want the code to print the actualtransformation path instead of just the length.
